# meetup-xstate


## Installation & libraries

* This project was created with [create-react-app Typescript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)

* I use the [XState library](xstate.js.org/) for the State Machines

  * XState is a pure Javascript & Typescript library, but you can use it in React. The `@xstate/react` library provides hooks utilities for React that are a very nice addition

- In order to get some basic UI, I used [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/). Installation steps can be followed [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)
