# meetup-xstate


## Installation & libraries

* This project was created with [create-react-app Typescript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)

`npx create-react-app meetup-xstate --template typescript`

* In order to get some basic UI, I used [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/)

  * Installation steps can be followed [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

  * Tailwind, craco and related topics are not the point of this project

* I use the [XState library](xstate.js.org/) for the State Machines

  * XState is a pure Javascript & Typescript library, but you can use it in React. The `@xstate/react` library provides hooks utilities for React that are a very nice addition


## Steps

* Base application with no JS #5ac6563
